**WORK PLAN

Teammates will collectively use the Six Sigma methodology when approaching projects, by doing the following:

Define: Outline the problem, goals, and deliverables for the project.

Measure: The team measures the initial performance of the process. These statistical measures make up a list of potential inputs.

Analyze: The team analyzes the process by isolating each guideline requirement to ensure it is fulfilled appropriately.

Improve: The team works from there to improve performance. Seek to exceed requirements.

Control: The group adds controls to the process to ensure it does not regress and become ineffective once again.

**CONFLICT RESOLUTION

Should a disagreement arise between Teammates. Teammates agree to: Identify the problem. Consider why this is a problem. Establish a plan of action and implement the solution. Ensure all parties are in agreement and some form of resolution is met in order to move forward.

Team compliance will be established by delegating tasks within the group and will be addressed accordingly to ensure equal distribution of work/task. Open lines of communication exist to insure understanding. Teammates will approach situations with a positive and open mindset. Teammates will address conflicts accordingly by being firm but fair in a respectable manner. When the end goal becomes affected, all agree deadlines will not be met and will push forward for a successful mission. Should resolution not be met, seek further guidance from outside sources (Instructors).
